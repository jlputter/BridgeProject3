# BridgeProject3
- To run the project simply clone it locally and run the client package
- The point here was to see how to use abstract the interface from the implementation. So we have two main classes which are 'Type' and 'vehicleStyle' which have two concrete implementations each. With this you can add another vehicle class to Type and a new style to vehicleStyle without having to change the interfaces or the super class.
